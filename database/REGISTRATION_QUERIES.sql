-- ============================================
-- 10. BACKUP AND RESTORE
-- ============================================

-- Backup: Get all users data

  r.name as role_name
FROM users u

ORDER BY u.created_at;

-- Get creation date for export filename
SELECT NOW()::DATE as backup_date;

-- ============================================
-- NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
-- ============================================

/*
1. NO EMAIL FIELDS:
   - Email has been completely removed from the system
   - No email field in the users table
   - No email in the registration form
   - No email validation
   - No email field in member profiles

2. FORM SUBMISSION FLOW:
   a) User fills registration form (no email field)
   b) Frontend validates all fields
   c) Frontend sends POST /api/register with data
   d) Server validates again (never trust client)
   e) Server inserts into users table
   f) generated_id auto-generates (E0001, F0001, etc.)
   
3. PDF GENERATION:
   a) User fills form and sees confirmation page
   b) Frontend generates PDF with jsPDF
   c) Frontend generates QR code with qrcode library
   d) Frontend uploads PDF to Supabase storage
   e) Frontend gets public URL from storage
   f) Frontend updates users.pdf_url with the URL
   
4. QUERYING:
   - Use member_profiles VIEW for most queries
   - It joins users → patrols → roles automatically
   - Makes queries simpler and more readable
   
5. PERFORMANCE:
   - All important columns have indexes
   - Avoid N+1 queries by using views
   - Paginate results (LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0)
   - Select only needed columns

6. SECURITY:
   - Always validate input on server side
   - Use prepared statements (Supabase handles this)
   - Never expose raw data in logs
   - Use RLS policies in Supabase
   
7. TIMESTAMPS:
   - created_at: Set once, never changes
   - updated_at: Auto-updated on every change
   - Always use UTC/ISO format for dates
   - Never manually set timestamps

8. GENERATED ID FORMAT:
   - E0001 to E9999 for males
   - F0001 to F9999 for females
   - Auto-generated on insert (don't set manually)
   - Used as primary identifier for members
   - Printed on PDF and embedded in QR code
